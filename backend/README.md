# AI Hacking League Backend README

## Overview

The AI Hacking League Backend is a FastAPI-based backend system designed to manage various aspects of the AI Hacking League, such as user authentication, challenges, leaderboard tracking, team management, and an AI-powered judicial system. This backend is modular, scalable, and integrated with Supabase for database handling and GitHub for repository management.

## Features

- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Implements registration, login, and user management.
- **Challenge Management**: Allows the creation, listing, and management of coding challenges with varying difficulty levels.
- **Leaderboard**: Tracks participants' progress and displays a global or challenge-specific leaderboard.
- **Team Management**: Supports team creation, listing, and management.
- **Supabase Integration**: Uses Supabase as the database backend for storing user, challenge, and team information.
- **GitHub Integration**: Creates GitHub repositories for coding challenges and maintains challenge repositories.
- **Secure Token Management**: JWT-based token creation for secure API access.
- **AI Judicial System**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4 to evaluate code submissions based on a weighted scoring system.
- **Docker Support**: The backend is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
- **Environment Configurations**: Sensitive credentials and configurations are stored securely using environment variables.

## AI Judicial System

### Overview

The AI Judicial System leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-4 model to automatically evaluate code submissions for challenges. The system provides objective scoring and feedback based on predefined evaluation criteria.

### Evaluation Criteria

1. **Functionality (40%)**: How well does the solution solve the given problem?
2. **Innovation (30%)**: Does the solution present novel approaches or creative use of AI technologies?
3. **Efficiency (20%)**: How optimized and performant is the code?
4. **Code Quality (10%)**: Is the code well-structured, readable, and following best practices?

### Configuration

To enable the AI Judicial System, ensure the following environment variable is set in your `.env` file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Additional configuration can be managed through the `app/core/config.py` file:

- **AI Model**: Default is `gpt-4`, but you can modify it by setting the `AI_MODEL` variable in the `.env` file if needed.

```bash
AI_MODEL=gpt-4
```

### Using the AI Judicial System

The `/judge/submit` endpoint allows users to submit their code for evaluation. The response will include a score out of 100 and detailed feedback for each of the evaluation criteria.

### Example

To submit a code file for evaluation, make a POST request to `/judge/submit` with the file as a form-data field. Optionally, you can include a `language` parameter to specify the programming language (default is Python).

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/judge/submit" \
  -F "file=@your_code.py" \
  -F "language=Python"
```

The response will include a detailed evaluation of the submission.

## Dependabot Configuration

Dependabot is configured to automatically check for updates to your dependencies and create pull requests to keep them up to date. The configuration is defined in the `backend/.github/dependabot.yml` file.

### Configuration File

The `dependabot.yml` file is located in the `.github` directory and contains the following configuration:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    target-branch: "main"
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    target-branch: "main"
  - package-ecosystem: "poetry"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    target-branch: "main"
```

### Auto-Merge Workflow

A GitHub Actions workflow is set up to automatically merge Dependabot pull requests if all checks pass. The workflow file is located in the `.github/workflows` directory and is named `dependabot-auto-merge.yml`.

### Workflow File

The `dependabot-auto-merge.yml` file contains the following configuration:

```yaml
name: Dependabot Auto Merge
